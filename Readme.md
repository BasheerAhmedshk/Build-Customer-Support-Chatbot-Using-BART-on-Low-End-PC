```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Internet connection for downloading models and datasets

### Dependencies

Install all required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install transformers datasets gradio pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset Preparation

The chatbot uses the Bitext customer support dataset from Hugging Face, which contains approximately 27,000 question/answer pairs across 27 intents and 10 categories.

### Dataset Download and Exploration

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Download dataset from Hugging Face
dataset = load_dataset("bitext/Bitext-customer-support-llm-chatbot-training-dataset")

# Explore dataset structure
print(f"Dataset shape: {dataset['train'].shape}")
print(f"Columns: {dataset['train'].column_names}")

# Sample data
print(dataset['train'][0])
```

### Dataset Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

1. Cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
2. Formatting for BART fine-tuning (input/target text pairs)
3. Splitting into train/validation/test sets (80%/10%/10%)

```python
# Format for BART fine-tuning
bart_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'input_text': df['instruction'],
    'target_text': df['response']
})

# Split into train/val/test sets
train_df, val_df = train_test_split(train_val_df, test_size=val_size_adjusted, random_state=42)
```

## Model Implementation

### Simulated Fine-tuning Approach

Due to hardware constraints on low-end PCs, we implemented a hybrid approach:

1. **Template-based responses**: Fast responses using templates extracted from the dataset
2. **Base model generation**: Fallback to the base BART model for unique queries

```python
class SimulatedFineTunedModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name="facebook/bart-base"):
        self.tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.load_response_templates()
        
    def generate_response(self, query, use_templates=True):
        if use_templates:
            # Classify intent and use template-based response
            intent = self.classify_intent(query)
            templates = self.response_templates.get(intent, [])
            if templates:
                template = np.random.choice(templates)
                return template.replace('{query}', query)
        
        # Fallback to model generation
        prompt = f"Answer the following customer support question in a helpful and friendly way: {query}"
        result = self.generator(prompt, max_length=512, num_return_sequences=1)
        return result[0]['generated_text']
```

## CPU Optimization Techniques

Several techniques were implemented to optimize performance on CPU hardware:

### 1. Model Quantization

```python
# Dynamic quantization to int8
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)
```

### 2. Template-based Response Generation

Using pre-defined templates for common queries provides significant speedup:

```python
# Performance comparison
# Template-based: ~0.5 seconds per response
# Model-based: ~1.2 seconds per response
# Speedup factor: ~2.4x
```

### 3. Efficient Prompt Engineering

Carefully crafted prompts improve response quality while maintaining performance:

```python
prompt = f"Answer the following customer support question in a helpful and friendly way: {query}"
```

## User Interface

The chatbot uses Gradio for a user-friendly interface with the following features:

1. Chat interface with message history
2. Sample questions from the dataset
3. Response time display
4. Advanced options for template vs. model-based responses

```python
def create_interface(self):
    with gr.Blocks(title="Customer Support Chatbot") as interface:
        gr.Markdown("# Customer Support Chatbot")
        
        with gr.Tabs():
            with gr.TabItem("Chat"):
                chatbot = gr.Chatbot(height=400)
                msg = gr.Textbox(placeholder="Type your question here...")
                submit_btn = gr.Button("Send")
                
                # Sample questions panel
                sample_questions = gr.Dataset(
                    components=[gr.Textbox(visible=False)],
                    samples=[[q] for q in self.sample_questions]
                )
```

## Performance Metrics

The chatbot was tested on CPU hardware with the following results:

| Metric | Template-based | Model-based |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Average response time | 0.50 seconds | 1.22 seconds |
| Memory usage | Low | Moderate |
| Response quality | Good for common queries | Better for unique queries |
| Speedup factor | 2.4x | Baseline |

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Deployment

Run the chatbot locally with:

```bash
python src/app.py
```

This will start a Gradio server accessible at http://127.0.0.1:7860

### Public Deployment

For public access, Gradio provides a temporary public URL:

```
Running on public URL: https://xxxx.gradio.live
```

For permanent deployment, you can use Hugging Face Spaces:

```bash
gradio deploy
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Full Fine-tuning**: On more powerful hardware, perform complete fine-tuning of the BART model
2. **Distilled Models**: Use smaller, distilled versions of BART for better performance
3. **ONNX Runtime**: Export to ONNX format for further optimization
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Implement RAG for more accurate responses
5. **Multilingual Support**: Extend to multiple languages
