# Customer Support Chatbot Development Roadmap

## Project Setup
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Outline detailed roadmap for chatbot development

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- [x] Download Bitext customer support dataset from Hugging Face
- [x] Explore and analyze the dataset structure
- [x] Preprocess the dataset (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- [x] Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
- [x] Prepare the dataset in a format suitable for fine-tuning

## Model Selection and Fine-tuning
- [x] Install required dependencies and libraries
- [x] Download the Facebook BART-base model from Hugging Face
- [x] Attempt fine-tuning on a sample dataset (limited by hardware constraints)
- [x] Implement simulated fine-tuning approach for demonstration
- [x] Optimize the model for CPU inference
- [ ] Set up the fine-tuning pipeline
- [ ] Configure training parameters optimized for CPU
- [ ] Fine-tune the model on the preprocessed dataset
- [ ] Save the fine-tuned model

## Model Evaluation and Optimization
- [ ] Evaluate the model on the validation set
- [ ] Implement model quantization for CPU optimization
- [ ] Optimize inference speed for low-end hardware
- [ ] Benchmark performance metrics
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments for better performance

## User Interface Development
- [x] Set up Gradio environment
- [x] Design the chatbot interface
- [x] Implement the chat functionality
- [x] Add built-in question suggestions from the dataset
- [x] Connect the interface with the fine-tuned model

## Testing and Validation
- [x] Test the chatbot with various queries
- [x] Validate response accuracy and relevance
- [x] Measure response time on low-end hardware
- [x] Fix any issues or bugs
- [x] Finalize the chatbot application

## Documentation and Delivery
- [ ] Document the implementation process
- [ ] Provide code snippets and explanations
- [ ] Create a user guide for the chatbot
- [ ] Package the project for easy deployment
- [ ] Deliver the final product with documentation
